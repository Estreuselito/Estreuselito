### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Yannik. Happy to have you here on my GitHub profile!ðŸŽ†ðŸŽˆðŸŽ‰

One of my best GitHub repos is definitely Bikerus. It is a completely reproducible repository, which ends up deploying a local flask app with Machine Learning models. You can check it out here. There is also a presentation and a written paper about this project within this repo.

Apart from that, my favorite idiom is *we will cross that bridge when we get there*. For me it states that sometimes, although there seems to be an insurmountable problem, mostly in the end the problem is not too hard to master.

I am always up for a chat, should you want to connect check [me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yannik-suhre-732a041a9/) out on LinkedIn.ðŸ’¬
